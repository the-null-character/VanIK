Good place to enjoy your food with your kids

The bakery item are so fresh since they are making by themselves. The quality is excellent also the price is moderate. The cakes are fresh and good in taste. Other sweet items also good.

The fast food such as pizza, sandwich, Samosas are feeah and good in taste, kids enjoying really. Especially the egg roll is extraordinary in taste also my favourite.

One more thing, they are not using fresh cow milk to prepare really and coffee.

Good and fast service

"The secret ingredient in baking is always love."

A bakery is a place where baked goods are made and sold. Bakery items typically include breads, cakes, pastries, cookies, and pies. Bakeries may also sell other food items, such as coffee, tea, and sandwiches.

Beverages are any liquid that can be drunk. They can be alcoholic or non-alcoholic, hot or cold, and sweet or savory. Some common beverages include water, coffee, tea, milk, juice, soda, and beer.

Bakeries and beverages are often paired together, as the sweet and savory flavors of baked goods can complement the taste of beverages. For example, a cup of coffee with a slice of chocolate cake is a classic combination.

There are many different types of bakeries and beverages available, so there is something for everyone to enjoy. Whether you are looking for a quick bite to eat or a leisurely meal, a bakery or beverage shop can be a great option.

Here are some examples of bakery and beverage pairings that you might enjoy:

*Unique Raagi mixture
* Coffee and cake
* Tea and scones
* Milkshake and cookies
* Soda and fries
* Beer and pretzels
*Mixture

If you are looking for a unique bakery or beverage experience, there are many options available. For example, you could try a bakery that specializes in gluten-free or vegan baked goods, or a beverage shop that serves craft beer or kombucha.

No matter what your taste, there is sure to be a bakery or beverage shop that you will love. So next time you are looking for something to eat or drink, be sure to check out your local bakery or beverage shop.

Review 3:
Ordered 2 normal meals it's good. Ordered tandoori chicken and requested  very less spicy for my kids, after 5 min again I remembered them for less spicy they said ok. Finally I got a very spicy chicken which my kids couldn't eat.
Please listen to customers mentioned specified request.
Other than that everything is good
Tidy place, play area for kids,parking, washroom available

Review 4:
The place is good to have a cup of Tea and snack on long rides..But since it is self service service it take lot of time to get and service is not quick..otherwise good ambience and lot of parking on highway side.

Review 5:
Decent stop over on highway for tea and snacks.
It also has swings for kids and enough sitting space for everyone.

Only downside is sitting area is open so in afternoon it would be little hot but very good weather in evenings and mornings.
